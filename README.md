Directory and Graphics Structure
================================
The "master" format for the graphics is in Illustrator.  The nmc-logo and nmc-triangle files are linked in the other graphics so that changes propogate.  I will eventually redo this using SVG but for now I have included straight SVG conversions.

Exporting is semi-automated and should eventually be done using GULP or a similar build tool.  For now, I've included Illustrator actions to convert to 1000px PNGs as well as XnConvert scripts for 100px, 250px, and 500px in /scripts/.
